<h1>This Site</h1>
<p><h3>This site is the culmination of the dreams of many a hunter seeking a new and thrilling sport.  We deliver a new
idea with our revolutionary jackalope and snipe hunting supplies site!  You can learn more about the jackalope and related critters
as well as the elusive snipe on our <a class="special" href="Preypage.html">Critter Page</a>, or you can skip the boring stuff and get right to the buying of hunting gear worthy
of putting a hole in a jackalope in our <a class="special" href="SuppliesPage.html">Online Store</a>!</h3></p>
<h1>Our Goal</h1>
<p><h3>Our goal is to bring devoted hunters the knowledge and gear they need to hunt the most elusive critters of the world through
our website.  By raising awareness of "fictional" critters such as jackalopes as well as real but rather rare critters such as snipes,
we hope to encourage the next generation as well as the current generation of hunters in a new and rewarding sport.</h3></p>
<h1>About Us</h1>
<p><h3>We are a group of friends and proud hunters who travel the world in search of the most exotic and challenging prey.  From the
mountain tops of Tibet to the Amazon Basin, we have hunted many of the world's most exotic and legal critters.  This page is meant
to share our dream of critter hunting as we ourselves continue the hunt on these most elusive of critters, the jackalope and snipe.
