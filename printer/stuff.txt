Low COM method


PrintLabel(DeviceName: String, Port: String, Quantity: Integer, bShowDialog: Boolean)

Prints the current label. DeviceName is the name of the device (such as “DYMO LabelWriter Turbo”). Port is the port on which the printer
is connected. If Port is File:, then output is directed to a file. Quantity is the number of copies to be printed, and bShowDialog is a
boolean used to display (TRUE) or hide (FALSE) the print progress dialog. Returns TRUE on success, FALSE otherwise.


AddObject(ObjType: Integer, Name: String; X,Y, Width, Height: Integer; Rotation: Integer)

Creates a new object on the label. ObjType is an integer that specifies the type of object to be created, where:
0 - TEXT
1 - ADDRESS
2 - GRAPHIC
3 - RECTANGLE
4 - LINE
5 - BARCODE
6 - COUNTER
7 - DATE_TIME
8 - CIRCULAR_TEXT

Name is the descriptive name to give the object (such as Return Address, Logo, or Product ID).
X, Y, Width, and Height are the location (X,Y) of the upper left corner of the object and the dimensions of the object, all expressed in TWIPS.
Rotation is the rotation to apply to the object and must be 0, 90, 180, or 270. This value is ignored when adding line or rectangle objects.

After adding an object, the LabelObject method can be used to provide the object-specific settings for the newly created object.
This function returns the ID for the new object, or 0 if the object could not be added.
